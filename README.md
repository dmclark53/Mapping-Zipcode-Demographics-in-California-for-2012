Practice using the R packages choroplethr and choroplethrMaps as inspired by the e-mail course by Ari Lamstein. In this project I explore demographics by zipcode for the zipcodes in San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara counties. All data provided by the American Community Survey (http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs).
